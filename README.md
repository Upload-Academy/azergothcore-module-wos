# World of Solocraft - QOL

This is an AzerothCore module. It's designed to change and update existing database entries, as well as add new ones, to the world database to make the World of Warcraft (WotLK) behave more akin to a single player game. In its current form it does not have any C++ code that needs to be compiled. It's simply utilising database changes.
